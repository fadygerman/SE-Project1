//MM20250417: This is my protocol, on what I did:
I followed the descriptions in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/getting-started-step-1.html
doing the local installation of the dynamoDB database in Java. I will gradually read and refactor the solution in
/backend so that we arrive at an implementation for AWS lambdas.

 + First attempt at modelling the existing databases into dynamoDB tables.
  . unclear, which data type shall be used for monetary values

 - design data tables:
  . e.g., bookings: primary hash key: car_id, secondary (global) key start date. Then use a Query in order to
    retrieve the appropriate values.
  . e.g., cars: primary hash key: car_id
  . standard table class? DynamoDB Standard table class vs. DynamoDB Standard IA table class
  . consider read size and capacity unit consumption! (transactional: 1.5; strongly consistent: 1; eventually consistent: 0.5;
    --> logging?
   > Query more efficient (financially and temporally) than single read requests
