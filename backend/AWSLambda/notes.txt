//MM20250417: This is my protocol, on what I did:
I followed the descriptions in https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/getting-started-step-1.html
doing the local installation of the dynamoDB database in Java. I will gradually read and refactor the solution in
/backend so that we arrive at an implementation for AWS lambdas.

 + First attempt at modelling the existing databases into dynamoDB tables.

USAGE (also described in the above resource):
 . download aws cli and start a local dynamodb client using command (Linux)
java -Djava.library.path=./DynamoDBLocal_lib -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb
 . execute databaseCreation.py

 - design data tables:
  . e.g., bookings: primary hash key: car_id, secondary (global) key start date. Then use a Query in order to
    retrieve the appropriate values.
  . e.g., cars: primary hash key: car_id
  . standard table class? DynamoDB Standard table class vs. DynamoDB Standard IA table class
  . consider read size and capacity unit consumption! (transactional: 1.5; strongly consistent: 1; eventually consistent: 0.5;
    --> logging?
   > Query more efficient (financially and temporally) than single read requests

 + managed to find a first solution to handling NoSQL (DynamoDB) through the lambda for "create_booking" (POST /v1/bookings)
 - route not implemented, but shouldn't be a biggie
 - need to change database from local to AWS-hosted (one of the last steps)
REMARK: Tried to implement using virtual environment (.venv) but wasn't able to get the imports right. will do that

 + combined route and backend
